# Run the proof suite against the YU15 cluster rig, in an order that works, with the port-forwards
# kept alive between proofs.
#
# WHY A RUNNER. Running the proofs back to back by hand does not work, and the reason is not
# obvious. Several of them ROLL THE CLUSTER -- yu13-cancel-ingress rolls the gateway,
# yu13-stp-and-replace rolls all three members -- and a rollout replaces the pod the port-forward is
# attached to, so the forward dies silently. Every proof after it then fails with a connection
# error that has nothing to do with what it tests. Measured directly: a clean sweep where four
# proofs "failed" and `curl localhost:18110/ready` returned 000 afterwards. Each of those four
# passes on its own.
#
# So: forwards are re-established and VERIFIED before every proof, not once at the start.
